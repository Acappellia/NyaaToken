## Change Logs

#### v0.1.2

- Fixed a bug that would cause reward resetting every time the server restarts.
- The reward giving now uses a smarter method which no longer relies on chunk loading.
- Added a toggle to keep shopkeepers' names and coordinates unchanged, so they will not be renamed or carried away with boats by accident.
- Please uninstall the previous version first to perform a clean update.
