## Change Logs

### v0.2.0

- Optimized advanced mode
    - The datapack now logs the exact types and amounts of reward items each player has got. 
    - No need to reset if new rewards are added in advanced mode by updating reward list. The datapack compares reward-giving logs with the new list, giving the rest of rewards.
- Added config backup for advanced mode
    - Each time the reward-giving is reset, configs and logs in advanced mode are cloned for backup.
- Added a command generator tool using python
    - It generates a command through the csv and helps configure in game.

### v0.1.3

- Added an advanced mode for complicated rewards.
    - It is based on a manually-configured reward list.
    - Reward-giving recognize players UUIDs instead of names in advanced mode.
    - Multiple rewards can be given at one time.

### v0.1.2

- Fixed a bug that would cause reward resetting every time the server restarts.
- The reward giving now uses a smarter method which no longer relies on chunk loading.
- Added a toggle to keep shopkeepers' names and coordinates unchanged, so they will not be renamed or carried away with boats by accident. 
    - This takes no effect on shops summoned by previous versions of this datapack.
- Please uninstall the previous version first to perform a clean update.
