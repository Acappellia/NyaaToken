1.20.1 +

## Usage

#### Installation

- Put the datapack folder in `/datapacks` folder in your world save just like any other datapacks.
- OR, just `git clone` this repository in `/datapacks` directory in world save.

#### Datapack Update

- Replace the old files with the new ones, or use `git pull` in `/datapacks` directory in world save.
- Use `/reload` in game to load the new version.
- If NyaaToken below version `v2.0` has already been installed, uninstalling before update is suggested to prevent some potential conflicts. The uninstall command is `/function nyaatoken:uninstall` in previous versions.

#### Add a new reward

- Start a new form, record a list of players and the reward item count for each player. Save the form in `.csv` format.
- The form should have the following format:

|Name       |item A     |item B     |...    |
|-          |-          |-          |...    |
|PlayerA    |12         |48         |...    |
|PlayerB    |15         |96         |...    |
|...        |...        |...        |...    |

> NOTE: The player names can duplicate, all rows of a player will sum together. Up to 9 kinds of items can be added at once.

- Use the `command_generator.py` tool to generate a long command, which can import your form into Minecraft game.
- Log into your server, copy the generated command into a command block and activate it.
- Create the reward items ingame, like a souvenir token.
- Align the items in your horbar from slot 1 to 9 in the same order of your form (item count does not matter), and execute the command `/function nt:edit/addreward`
- Now the reward is added. Use `/function nt:maintogggle` to turn on player-receiving.

#### Setting the location for players to receive rewards

- Choose a location to place a command block.

> NOTE: The blocks above y=255 in the column of the command block should contain at least 2 continuous air blocks. This will happen in most cases, here is just a reminder because we need locations to place temporary shulker boxes

- Type `function nt:player/get` in command block
- Use `/function nt:maintogggle` to turn on the player-receiving feature
- Players can now activate this command block to get their rewards

#### Villager shop editing

- This is simple. Just refer to the `Command` section.
